## Exercise Summary
### Exercise 1: Assess on‑premises/web apps for cloud migration readiness
- **Goal:** Determine migration feasibility and priority for sample applications prior to moving to Azure App Service.
- **Key actions:** Run environment/provider registration; perform readiness checks and an Azure Migrate–style assessment to identify dependencies, configuration gaps, and target SKUs; capture sizing and compatibility notes for each app.
- **Validation:** Confirm assessment reports indicate required providers are registered and apps show a “ready to migrate”/green status with recommended App Service plans.

### Exercise 2: Prepare and migrate a Blazor app to Azure App Service
- **Goal:** Deploy a reference .NET/Blazor site to Azure App Service with minimal changes.
- **Key actions:** Create or select a resource group and App Service plan; publish the Blazor app; configure app settings and connection strings; verify runtime stack and health checks.
- **Validation:** Browse to the App Service URL and confirm application loads, basic routes render, and logs show healthy startup.

### Exercise 3: Migrate an enterprise web app and enable observability
- **Goal:** Move a more complex app and instrument it for reliability.
- **Key actions:** Configure staging slot(s); enable Application Insights; configure availability tests and alerts; turn on deployment logging; review live metrics.
- **Validation:** Synthetic availability test passes; Application Insights shows requests, dependencies, and exceptions; swap or restart completes without errors.

### Exercise 4: Optimize, scale, and finalize cut‑over
- **Goal:** Ensure the migrated workload meets performance/SLA targets.
- **Key actions:** Apply autoscale rules, adjust instance size/count, configure Always On and ARR affinity as needed; tighten access (private endpoints or access restrictions); rehearse rollback.
- **Validation:** Load checks meet target latency; scale rules trigger as expected; post‑cutover checks (health probes, logs, dashboards) remain green.
