## Exercise Summary
### Exercise 0: Provision APIM with AI Gateway features
- **Goal:** Stand up an APIM instance ready for LLM traffic.
- **Actions:** Deploy APIM, create products/subscriptions, and configure workspace for AI Gateway experiments.
- **Validation:** APIM developer portal reachable; sample test-call returns 200.

### Exercise 1: Register LLM backends & routing
- **Goal:** Front multiple LLM backends (Azure OpenAI / AI Foundry Inference) behind APIM.
- **Actions:** Create backends, named values, and policies for model routing and region failover.
- **Validation:** Requests are routed per model/version; fallback verified.

### Exercise 2: Reliability & Observability
- **Goal:** Add retries, circuit breaker, token metrics, and logging.
- **Actions:** Apply `retry`, `forward-request` streaming, `emit-metric`, and built‑in LLM logging; connect to Azure Monitor.
- **Validation:** Logs capture token counts and latency; dashboard shows traffic and 429s.

### Exercise 3: Safety & FinOps
- **Goal:** Enforce content safety and cost controls.
- **Actions:** Add Content Safety policy, rate limits/quotas, and product‑level budgets; wire alerts to Logic Apps.
- **Validation:** Unsafe prompts blocked; budget breach triggers automation.
