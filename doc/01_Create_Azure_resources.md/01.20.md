## Exercise Summary
### Exercise 1: Orientation and RTI overview
- **Goal:** Understand Real‑Time Intelligence (RTI) and medallion layers in Fabric.
- **Key actions:** Review Bronze/Silver/Gold concepts; map RTI components (Eventstream, Eventhouse, KQL, Dashboards) to layers.
- **Validation:** Participants can articulate how RTI services implement a medallion pipeline.

### Exercise 2: Create event ingestion with Eventstream
- **Goal:** Ingest simulated click/impression events in real time.
- **Key actions:** Start the producer; create an Eventstream; verify inbound events; switch Live/Edit modes as needed.
- **Validation:** Live events appear in the Eventstream canvas and message counters advance.

### Exercise 3: Route events to Eventhouse and create the `events` table
- **Goal:** Persist streaming data for querying.
- **Key actions:** Add Eventhouse as a destination; configure workspace/item targets; publish; create a new `events` table.
- **Validation:** Destination shows **Configured**; `events` table exists and receives records.

### Exercise 4: Transform with KQL and explore with Copilot
- **Goal:** Derive insights from streaming data with minimal code.
- **Key actions:** Author KQL queries (with Copilot assistance) to aggregate sessions/metrics; create materialized views for Silver/Gold stages.
- **Validation:** Queries return expected aggregates; views update as events flow.

### Exercise 5: Build a real‑time dashboard and automate actions
- **Goal:** Visualize and react to live signals.
- **Key actions:** Pin KQL results to a Real‑Time Dashboard; configure alerts/actions.
- **Validation:** Dash tiles update live; alert fires under threshold conditions.
