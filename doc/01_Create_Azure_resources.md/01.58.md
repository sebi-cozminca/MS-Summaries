## Exercise Summary

### Exercise 1: Prepare your environment for compliance administration
- Enabled auditing in the Microsoft Purview portal to track user and admin activities across Microsoft 365.
- Turned on device onboarding in Purview to prepare for endpoint DLP policy enforcement.
- Onboarded a Windows 11 device using a local onboarding script, ensuring it can be monitored and protected by Endpoint DLP policies.

### Exercise 2: Create custom sensitive information types
- Created a custom sensitive information type called **Contoso Employee IDs** to detect employee identifiers in emails and documents.
- Configured a regex pattern with supporting keywords ("Employee", "ID") for detection.
- Ensured classification and detection of sensitive employee IDs to prevent accidental sharing.

### Exercise 3: Create sensitivity labels
- Enabled co-authoring support for files with sensitivity labels to allow secure collaboration in SharePoint and OneDrive.
- Created a parent sensitivity label (**Internal**) to protect Contosoâ€™s internal files and emails.
- Added a sublabel (**Employee data (HR)**) with encryption, offline access restrictions, and dynamic watermarking to secure HR data.
- Published both labels so they are available to apply to organizational content, including support for Microsoft 365 Copilot scenarios.

### Exercise 4: Explore Data Security Posture Management (DSPM) for AI
- Explored DSPM for AI in Microsoft Purview to review security recommendations related to generative AI use.
- Applied a recommendation to create adaptive DLP policies that block or warn risky users attempting to paste/upload sensitive information into AI tools.
- Validated creation of AI-specific policies and reviewed monitoring options.

### Exercise 5: Create a DLP policy
- Created a **Generative AI sharing DLP policy** in simulation mode targeting endpoint devices.
- Configured rules to detect **Contoso Employee IDs** and credit card data, blocking pasting/uploading into generative AI websites.
- Enabled user notifications and policy tips to educate employees about safe handling of sensitive data.
- (Optional) Activated the policy to enforce restrictions in production.

### Exercise 6: Create an Insider Risk Management policy
- Configured risky browsing indicators in Insider Risk Management settings to track suspicious activity.
- Created a **Sensitive Data Protection** insider risk policy to monitor risky web browsing and alert on actions that could expose sensitive data.
- Enabled default thresholds and indicators to generate alerts when risky browsing occurs.

### Exercise 7: Create an Adaptive Protection policy
- Enabled Adaptive Protection in Insider Risk Management, linking it to the **Sensitive Data Protection** policy.
- Configured insider risk levels to dynamically adjust enforcement of DLP policies based on user behavior.
- Turned on Adaptive Protection to provide stricter controls for high-risk users while maintaining flexibility for low-risk users.
