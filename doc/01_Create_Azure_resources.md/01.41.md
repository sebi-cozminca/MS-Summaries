## Exercise Summary
### Exercise 0: Access the Alpine Ski House tenant
- **Goal:** Sign into Defender portal with the lab account.
- **Actions:** Log into the VM, open security.microsoft.com in InPrivate, and authenticate with lab credentials.
- **Validation:** Landing in Microsoft Defender XDR with the tenant context set.

### Exercise 1: KQL basics for hunting
- **Goal:** Learn the KQL pipeline model and core operators.
- **Actions:** Practice `take`, `count`, `where`, time filtering with `ago()`/`between`, and column shaping with `project`.
- **Validation:** Queries execute with expected record counts and performance improvements from better filters.

### Exercise 2: String operators and performance
- **Goal:** Use case‑sensitive/insensitive operators effectively.
- **Actions:** Compare `contains` vs `has`, use `startswith_cs`, `in`, and `has_any` for precision; add null checks and narrower time ranges.
- **Validation:** “Good examples” run faster and return more relevant rows.

### Exercise 3: Advanced operators and data shaping
- **Goal:** Work with joins, unions, JSON, materialize, functions, and make‑series.
- **Actions:** Build multi‑table hunts and summarize patterns across time; modularize queries into functions.
- **Validation:** Complex hunts return correct aggregates and are reusable.

### Exercise 4: Threat hunting scenarios
- **Goal:** Apply KQL to real attacks.
- **Actions:** Hunt for AiTM, BEC, malicious PowerShell, Mimikatz/Impacket, UEBA signals, suspicious Office, and third‑party log IOC matches.
- **Validation:** Queries surface expected events; detections or bookmarks captured for follow‑up.
