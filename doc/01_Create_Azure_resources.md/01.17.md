## Exercise Summary
### Exercise 0: Setup and Run Starter Application
- Login to VM and clone project repository.  
- Configure authentication with Entra ID for Azure resources.  
- Build and run starter Blazor app in VS Code.  
- Validate connectivity through Aspire Dashboard.  

### Exercise 1: Implement Semantic Kernel
- Add Azure OpenAI Chat Completion service to the app.  
- Update `SemanticKernelService.cs` to process prompts and generate completions.  
- Integrate completions into `ChatService.cs` and test with Aspire Dashboard.  

### Exercise 2: Implement Chat History (Context Window)
- Add support for storing conversation history in Cosmos DB.  
- Query prior messages to create a token-limited context window.  
- Pass context window into Semantic Kernel for more relevant responses.  
- Validate improved contextual responses in chat app.  

### Exercise 3: Implement RAG Pattern
- Add OpenAI embeddings generation service.  
- Use Cosmos DB with vector search to ground responses with real product data.  
- Pass embeddings + context into Semantic Kernel.  
- Validate AI responses use actual database product data instead of general knowledge.
