## Exercise Summary
### Exercise 1: Explore retrieval modes
- **Goal:** Compare keyword, vector, and hybrid/semantic retrieval in Azure AI Search.
- **Actions:** Create index, load sample docs and embeddings; run queries across retrieval modes.
- **Validation:** Side‑by‑side results show precision/recall trade‑offs; choose default for the app.

### Exercise 2: Adjust semantic ranker
- **Goal:** Improve answer quality via semantic configuration.
- **Actions:** Enable semantic ranker, tune configuration (captions, answers), and evaluate on sample questions.
- **Validation:** Higher judged relevance; fewer off‑topic answers.

### Exercise 3 (Optional): Automated evaluation
- **Goal:** Score responses automatically with built‑in evaluators.
- **Actions:** Run evaluation notebook to compute groundedness, coherence, harmful content flags.
- **Validation:** Report shows pass thresholds and flags regressions.

### Exercise 4: Enable agentic features
- **Goal:** Add tool use and multi‑step orchestration on top of RAG.
- **Actions:** Integrate agent runtime (AI Foundry/SDK) with tools (search, calculator, external API) and memory.
- **Validation:** Traces show tool‑calling and corrective steps; user tasks completed end‑to‑end.
