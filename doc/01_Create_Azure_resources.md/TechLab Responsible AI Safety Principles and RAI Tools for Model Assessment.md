## Exercise Summary

**Exercise 1: Evaluate Bias and Fairness in AI Systems**
- **Goal:** Assess and mitigate bias and fairness issues in machine learning models using Fairlearn in Azure Machine Learning.
- **Actions:**
  - Load and preprocess a credit loan dataset (handle missing values, encode categorical variables, split data).
  - Train a fairness-unaware model to predict loan defaults.
  - Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.
  - Assess model fairness with Fairlearn toolkit.
  - Calculate fairness metrics (equalized odds difference, false negative/positive rates, selection rate).
  - Identify disparities across demographic groups.
  - Apply fairness mitigation techniques (ThresholdOptimizer, ExponentiatedGradient) using Fairlearn.
  - Re-evaluate and compare performance and fairness metrics post-mitigation.
- **Validation:**
  - Success is verified by improved fairness metrics and documented comparison of original vs. mitigated model performance.

**Exercise 2: Red Teaming GenAI Applications for RAI**
- **Goal:** Identify and address potential weaknesses in AI systems through red teaming activities.
- **Actions:**
  - Learn fundamentals of red teaming for AI safety and security.
  - Identify biases and vulnerabilities in AI systems.
  - Conduct rigorous testing to improve model robustness and reliability.
- **Validation:**
  - Success is verified by identifying vulnerabilities and documenting improvements in model robustness and reliability.

**Lab Completion**
- **Validation:**
  - Submit the lab in the Skillable platform and confirm completion status in Viva and Learning Path the following week.
