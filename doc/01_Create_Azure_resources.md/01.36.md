## Exercise Summary
### Exercise 0: Environment and dataset prep
- **Goal:** Set up Azure resources and prepare a small, well‑formatted training set.
- **Actions:** Log into the subscription, stage training/validation data in storage, and review LoRA hyperparameter options.
- **Validation:** Data is accessible from the training runtime and schema checks pass.

### Exercise 1: Baseline evaluation of Phi Silica
- **Goal:** Establish a baseline before fine‑tuning.
- **Actions:** Run an evaluation notebook/pipeline using zero‑shot or few‑shot prompts across a sample set.
- **Validation:** Baseline metrics (accuracy/latency/cost) captured for comparison.

### Exercise 2: Fine‑tune with LoRA adapters
- **Goal:** Train a task‑specific adapter on your dataset.
- **Actions:** Launch a LoRA training job, monitor logs, and checkpoint artifacts; tune rank/alpha and learning rate.
- **Validation:** Training completes; best checkpoint saved; loss curves and validation set metrics improve.

### Exercise 3: Register and serve the adapted model
- **Goal:** Operationalize the LoRA‑adapted Phi Silica.
- **Actions:** Register the model, attach the adapter at inference, and deploy an endpoint with content‑safety settings.
- **Validation:** Endpoint returns grounded responses consistent with the dataset; rate limits and safety filters enforced.

### Exercise 4: Post‑tuning evaluation & rollback plan
- **Goal:** Verify improvements and readiness.
- **Actions:** Re‑run evaluation vs baseline, perform A/B checks, and document rollback/retire steps for the adapter.
- **Validation:** Target metrics met; deployment change record completed.
