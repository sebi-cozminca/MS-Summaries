## Exercise Summary

### Exercise 1: Configuring the lab environment
- Set up the lab domain by generating a unique lab number at O365Ready.com and delegating DNS to the RRAS01 server.  
- Add and verify the custom lab domain in Azure Active Directory.  
- Complete domain setup in Microsoft 365 admin center.  
- Request and obtain a public certificate from DigiCert for the SBC, preparing secure communications.  

### Exercise 2: Configuring the session border controller (SBC)
- Assign the custom lab domain to Teams users Diego Siciliani and Patti Fernandez.  
- Retrieve the issued public certificate from DigiCert via Outlook, import it, and export to PFX format for SBC usage.  
- Upload the SBC configuration file and trusted root certificates into the AudioCodes SBC.  
- Install and configure the lab-specific certificate on the SBC.  
- Configure SIP outbound manipulation and restart SBC to apply settings.  

### Exercise 3: Deploying Direct Routing in Microsoft 365
- Verify DNS resolution of the SBC hostname and test SIP connectivity (Telnet on port 5061).  
- Connect the SBC to Microsoft Teams by creating an Online PSTN Gateway in Teams PowerShell.  
- Validate SBC pairing and monitor settings in Teams Admin Center.  
- Enable debug logging in the SBC and monitor SIP flow in Syslog Viewer.  
- Configure voice routes and PSTN usages to enable call routing through the SBC.  
- Assign Direct Routing phone numbers to Diego Siciliani and Patti Fernandez.  
- Create and assign a voice routing policy (“North America”) to these users.  
- Test calls using Teams client and 3CX softphone, validating inbound and outbound scenarios.  
- Review CDR history and SIP logs to confirm call flows and signaling details.
