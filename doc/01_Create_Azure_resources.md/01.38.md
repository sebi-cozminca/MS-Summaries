## Exercise Summary
### Part 0: Setup & Data Context
- **Goal:** Understand bus delay scenario using digital twin builder.
- **Actions:** Explore bus data (movement/timing) and stop data (geo/contextual).
- **Validation:** Data schema confirms readiness for modeling.

### Part 1: Upload Contextual Data
- **Goal:** Prepare lakehouse with static stop data.
- **Actions:** Create Fabric workspace/lakehouse, upload CSV, and load into table.
- **Validation:** Stops_data table created and populated.

### Part 2: Get Streaming Data
- **Goal:** Simulate real-time bus events.
- **Actions:** Create Eventhouse, Eventstream with Buses sample, transform fields, and ingest to bus_data_raw.
- **Validation:** Data flows; transformed schema available in Eventhouse.

### Part 3: Build Ontology with Digital Twin Builder
- **Goal:** Contextualize streaming + static data into ontology.
- **Actions:** Use Digital Twin Builder to model bus routes, stops, and attributes.
- **Validation:** Ontology connects fact/dimension data.

### Part 4: Project to Eventhouse & Query
- **Goal:** Expose ontology to Eventhouse and run KQL queries.
- **Actions:** Create shortcuts, query arrival times/delays, aggregate by route/borough.
- **Validation:** Queries yield bus lateness insights.

### Part 5: Real-Time Dashboard
- **Goal:** Visualize insights interactively.
- **Actions:** Build Real-Time Dashboard in Fabric; add KQL visuals.
- **Validation:** Dashboard shows delay patterns and geographic hotspots.
