## Exercise Summary
### Exercise 0: Prepare Azure DevOps & environment
- **Goal:** Ensure the repo and pipelines environment is ready to deploy secure MLOps infra.
- **Actions:** Rename the seeded Azure DevOps project, verify Microsoft-hosted parallel jobs, and confirm access to the subscription.
- **Validation:** Project and pipeline capacity confirmed; you can create service connections and run pipelines successfully.

### Exercise 1: Create Azure AD service principal for deployment
- **Goal:** Provision least‑privileged identity for infra automation.
- **Actions:** Use Cloud Shell to create a service principal with subscription‑scope Contributor; capture appId, tenant, and secret.
- **Validation:** SPN details recorded; RBAC assignment shows in Access control (IAM).

### Exercise 2: Configure Azure DevOps service connection
- **Goal:** Allow pipelines to authenticate to Azure.
- **Actions:** Create an **Azure Resource Manager** service connection with the SPN (secret), scope **Subscription**, and grant to all pipelines.
- **Validation:** Service connection **verified and saved**; can list resources in test pipeline.

### Exercise 3: Import MLOps (v2) repo and review security baselines
- **Goal:** Seed infra as code using Azure MLOps (v2) templates with security controls.
- **Actions:** Import the repo, inspect templates for network isolation, managed identity, and secrets governance.
- **Validation:** Repo imported; pipelines reference secured templates and pass preflight checks.

### Exercise 4: Deploy baseline and validate controls
- **Goal:** Stand up secured MLOps reference environment.
- **Actions:** Run pipeline to provision core resources (Azure ML workspace, key vault, network, storage) with policy/role baselines.
- **Validation:** Deployment completes; resources show private endpoints/role assignments; portal and pipeline logs clean.
