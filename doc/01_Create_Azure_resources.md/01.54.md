## Exercise Summary

### Exercise 1: Zero Trust Architecture Review
- Study the Zero Trust architecture diagram for the Enterprise RAG resource group.  
- Identify components: Virtual Network, Private Endpoints (OpenAI, Storage, Search, Cosmos DB, Key Vault), App Service Plan, Data Science VM via Bastion, subnets with RBAC, and Key Vault for secrets.  
- Review authentication and authorization with Entra ID and RBAC applied at subnet and app levels.  
- Understand benefits: enhanced security, minimized attack surface, regulatory compliance, and operational monitoring.  

### Exercise 2: Application Deployment
- Confirm **AZURE_NETWORK_ISOLATION** is set to **true**, isolating resources within VNets.  
- Sign in to the Windows 11 VM and monitor deployment logs until completion.  
- Log into Azure portal and verify presence of networking resources (VNets, private endpoints, DNS zones, NICs, NSGs).  
- Connect to the **testvm** using Bastion with credentials retrieved from Key Vault.  
- Install PowerShell 7, update `azd`, initialize environment, authenticate with Azure, refresh environment, and deploy GPT-RAG under Zero Trust conditions.  

### Exercise 3: Test/Validate Networking Configuration
- Perform **external tests** from the public network: confirm access to the frontend web app, orchestrator API, and blob storage is blocked with **403 errors**.  
- Perform **internal tests** via Bastion VM: access the deployed web app frontend and blob storage, confirming Zero Trust allows internal trusted access.  
- Validate overall that Zero Trust successfully enforces private, authenticated, and authorized access boundaries.
